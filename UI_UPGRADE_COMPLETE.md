## 🛠️ TROUBLESHOOTING

### Issue: Weather not showing
**Solution**: Wait 30 seconds for first fetch, check internet

### Issue: High CPU usage
**Solution**: Reduce particle count in code (line ~508)
```python
self.max_particles = 50  # Instead of 80
```

### Issue: Missing emojis (avatar)
**Solution**: Requires Windows 10+ with emoji font support

### Issue: Notifications not working
**Solution**: They auto-track, just say commands to see them appear
